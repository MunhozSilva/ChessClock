# ChessClock

## About

ChessClock is an application created to practice my personal studies, which I apply several concepts that I have been studying.

## Concepts worked on this project

- ***Service***: It is an application component that allows the clock to keep running even when the user switch the app to the background
- ***Dialogs***: This view shows an pop-up so the user can interact to set game modes
- ***Dark Theme***: The app switches between light theme and dark theme by choosing through user's phone theme preference
- ***Constraint Layout***: Guide lines can adapt the screen proportion to better responsivity depending on the screen size
- ***Accessibility***: Low time animations and large buttons display were implemented with care to help user experience. Besides, all interactives elements have content description
- ***Internationalization***: Translations to portuguese if the user's phone language is set to portuguese
